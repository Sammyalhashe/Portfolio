      * The original dataset consisted of more than 500 unique car trips.

      * This data was presented in the form of Json and all together had a total
      size of about 70M.

      * I initially tried to load the entire dataset on the map at once, but
      displaying the geolocation lines of 70M of data on the map was way too
      slow. 

      * To get around this, I adopted a methodology to split the database based
      on different zooms of the map.
        * The idea was that the larger the zoom, the less geolocation points were needed to be rendered on the map.
        * To partition the dataset, I decided to take data every `n` seconds
          * Under further consideration, I should have split by the distance to get more consistent visual results.

      * This was a complete full-stack application, with the frontend written in
      Angular, and the backend an expressJS application that connects to a
      MongoDB connection storing the trip data.

      * One of the best lessons I learned from this was the ability to configure
      a full application correctly, and more importantly, organize it in such a
      way to make it easy to _deploy_.

      * During this coding challenge, I was given a week to present my final
      product.

      * This was by far the quickest application I had to develop, and it was
      really daunting at first.

      * I decided to take a very structured approach to this:
        * I would first research, fully knowing the components/techniques I would be using before I even hit the keyboard.
        * I committed to fully engaging with any documentation I read.
        * I tackled one issue at a time to keep my conerns modular.
          * I first tackled setting up the database and writing scripts to partition the data.
          * Then I worked on wipping up a simple expressJS application to connect to the Mongo database.
            * Once I knew that loading 72mb of data onto a UI would lead to an inefficient algorithm, I eventually created three endpoints (and thus three mongo collections) based on zoom.
          * I mainly worked on the frontend in tandem with the express app.
            * My main issue with the frontend was researching ways to display car's geolocation and how to performantly load and cache json data.

### Summary

* Completed a coding challenge requiring me to create a performant web app displaying more than 500 different car trips.
* These car trips were made for data collection for self-driving cars.
* Each trip is a `json` file with a start and end time. The `json` file also contains a `coords` array, which contains data points sampled every second during the trip. Each data point contains the coordinates and the speed at the time of sampling.

### Backend

* The backend was built using a simple `express` app. The express app has three routes; one for each of the datasets. It is a pretty simple frontend with nothing that fancy. I wanted to do more data parsing on the server end, but the map package, `leaflet`, made this difficult as it requires the coordinates to be wrapped in a function that defines layers on top of the map, which is not available in the backend. One option that could have been worth looking more into was
  `leaflet-headless` which seemed to get around the inability to use the package in the backend (it defines a "pseudo-window"), but as I have school I couldn't really look into it anymore.

### Database

* The data was loaded into a Mongodb Atlas cluster. The datasets were split into three different collections based on different zooms of the map.

### Frontend

The frontend was built in `angular`. Its breakdown is as follows:

* `AppModule` is the main module
  * imports the `RoutingModule` and `MaterialModule` which imports Angular Material Components
  * `AppComponent` that the app bootstraps to; it contains the route outlet where other routes are placed.
  * `MapComponent`, which contains the actual map and displays the data.
    * [`leaflet`](https://leafletjs.com/) is the package used to create the interactive map.
      In routing to the map component, data is prefetched before the component loads using a route resolver. This resolver uses another service, `TripsService`, to fetch the data, which acts as a global way to fetch data and change state depending on if data is being fetched or not. Data is parsed on the client side, which I wanted to change.

Client-side caching is implemented with an `HttpInterceptor`. When data is being fetched, it checks whether the data has already been recieved and stored in a cache. If it hasn't, the data is downloaded, but if it has, the data is simply taken from the cache.

- Worked on the development of test structures and designs using Microsemi's design software, Libero, to assess and characterize Microsemi FPGA products that went to market.
- By writing test-structures in verilog, I characterized the Mathblock component of Microsemi's G5 FPGA product as well as performance-related AC tests on other combinatorial and sequential elements found in the FPGA.
    - Example components include look-up tables, carry chains, digital I/O's, characterized mainly for max frequency.
- AC characterization was done on Verigy 93k testers offsite using test vectors generated on site.
- Inside Libero, I created Verilog test structures, making use of JTAG to read input from test programs created using a company code.
- Wrote sections of the characterization report found in the official product manual used to facilitate customer knowledge in our device.

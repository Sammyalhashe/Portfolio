lessons: [c++, python bindings, lock-free, middleware programming]

* Worked on the design and implementation of an existing internal pub/sub middleware system that stream- lines data from backend to frontend on Bloomberg’s terminal
    * This product is the driving force behind delivering dynamic data to Bloomberg’s clients.
* Worked with sister teams to integrate their routing and entitlement products into the pub/sub framework.
    * Reorganized the internal mechanisms of how the pub/sub framework currently handles routing to account for this new routing logic.
    * Added shared libraries that multiple tasks link in to provide entitlement information when needed to enhance infrastructure security.
* Own and manage the python bindings that wrap the c++ sdk.
* Worked on the internal c++ guild in its inter-thread communication working group.
    * Conducted code reviews of multithreaded code, and learned a great deal of lock free programming.

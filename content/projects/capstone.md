      This was my third time working on a large engineering project that had
      real-world implications. The first was a semester-long design project
      where my team designed a pre-flight briefing to help prevent injuries
      during a floatplane crash. The second was a semester-long project where my
      team and I built a robot that could scan pipes for "radioactive material"
      (it was actually just black dots). The robot would be entered into a
      competition at the end of the semester, in which we qualified :). During
      this project, it was the first time where I really learned how to be a
      leader. I held team meetings every Tuesday as a part status update and
      part organizational meeting. These meetings discussed topics such as what
      deadlines were approaching as well as an opportunity to discuss various
      design option/decisions with the team.
    lesson: Learned to manage and collaborate as a team as a leader

      This was my first project where I had actual stakeholders reliant on the
      outcome of the project. The goal of this charter was to replace the
      outdated Labview charters with software developed in python in UofT's
      Advanced Physics Laboratory. The lab wanted the charter done in python so
      it could be flexible to their own modifications. During our weekly
      meetings, the team and I weekly connected with the lab to give a status
      update and a mini-project demo. We did so to make sure the end-product
      would be to the stakeholder's specifications. In addition, if they did not
      like some feature, they would let us know well in advance.
    lesson: Learned to collaborate with stakeholders frequently

* Built a charting application that reads data that is interfaced from a _ni daqmx_ board and serial ports
* The actual chart was built using python, `RxPY` and `pyqt5` and is able to display any number of channels vs. time/other channel.
* Various transformations on charted data, including Fast-Fourier Transform and logarithmic transforms are also available.
* In production at UofT's Advanced Physics Lab.

    - lesson: Learned to manage and collaborate as a team as a leader
      description: 'This was my third time working on a large engineering project that had real-world implications. The first was a semester-long design project where my team designed a pre-flight briefing to help prevent injuries during a floatplane crash. The second was a semester-long project where my team and I built a robot that could scan pipes for "radioactive material" (it was actually just black dots). The robot would be entered into a competition at the end of the semester, in which we qualified :). During this project, it was the first time where I really learned how to be a leader. I held team meetings every Tuesday as a part status update and part organizational meeting. These meetings discussed topics such as what deadlines were approaching as well as an opportunity to discuss various design option/decisions with the team.'

- Built a charting application that reads data that is interfaced from a _ni daqmx_ board and serial ports
- The actual chart was built using python, `RxPY` and `pyqt5` and is able to display any number of channels vs. time/other channel.
- Various transformations on charted data, including Fast-Fourier Transform and logarithmic transforms are also available.
- In production at UofT's Advanced Physics Lab.
